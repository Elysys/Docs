Elysys Loans Module	

This document describes the standard functionalities of the Loans module of Elysys Loans for Microsoft Dynamics Business Central, as well as the required setup. A loan can be either a lending or a borrowing. Three types of loans can be managed within the system:

- Interest only repayment
- Fixed capital repayment
- Fixed capital and interest repayment


# NAVCash General Setup

The user must make sure the following settings had been set up: 

<!--- ![Graphical user interface, table Description automatically generated](Aspose.Words.d55efba7-ee5d-4ac2-a23a-5f74477c2752.002.png) --->
**Figure 1 NAVCash General Setup**

**General FastTab:** select the Portfolio and the Instrument dimensions to be used. These 2 dimensions will be used to track all entries generated by the system when posting a loan’s capital and interest payments. If the Dimensions do not exist, you will need to create them. 

When posting entries in a foreign currency, adjusting entries might be generated and will be posted to the account filled in “Rounding Adj. Account”. Then select a number series to number the accrued interest entries.

**Loans FastTab:** Select a number series for “Loans Nos” field to number all new loans. This will be used to create the instrument code which will be used to track the loan throughout the system.  The Renew Loan Template and Batch fields need to be filled in if renewed loans are used. 

**Bundled Loans and Sales Invoice FastTab:** Select a number series for “Bundled Loans Nos” field to  number all new bundled loans. By default, loans linked to a customer will generate a Sales Invoice but will let the user review it before posting. If the “Post Loan Sales Invoices” option is selected however, the Sales Invoice will be posted automatically when processing the loan.

At least one portfolio needs exist to create a loan. The Portfolio Currency (PCY) is compulsory as the financial system will calculate all amounts against PCY and LCY. Portfolios created from Elysys Wealth setup will appear in this list. 

If a new portfolio needs to be created, click the Button: New.

Exchange rates to be used specially with the Loans & Deposits module can be imported using the NAVCash Curr. Exchange Rate page. If this is not necessary, make sure to tick the box “Financial base rates for PCY” on the Portfolio Card to use standard NAV’s currency exchange rates.

Each loan is linked to an instrument type. The instrument type will define the accounting rules to be used during the loan’s lifetime. Create one or more instrument types based on how many accounting rules you require.

For each instrument type previously created, a set of accounts need to be filled in. They will be used for the different functions performed on the loans such as the interest repayments (PNL Interest), revaluation (PNL/BS UR), the accrued interest (PNL/BS Accrued Interest) and the closing (PL Realised).


## Counterparty Setup


The financial system can manage Customer Loans (lending) and Bank Loans (lending and borrowing). Standard Business Central Customer & Bank modules are used for this purpose. 

The user must select on the Loan Card the Counterparty Type and Counterparty Account to be used.

## Loan Types

The loans module allows the management of the following types of loans:

- Interest Only Repayment: loan in which, for a set term, the borrower pays only the interest on the principal balance;
- Fixed Capital And Interest Repayment: loan in which, for a set term, the total due (capital + interest repayments) is constant. The total due can be changed by the user if needed and the Maturity Date will change accordingly.
- Fixed Capital Repayment: loan in which, for a set term, the capital repaid is unchanged by period and the interest repayment is variable.

## Postponement Types

Only loans type 2 can be postponed. There are 3 types of postponement:

- Total – with capitalised interest: the total due amount is zero until the Starting Date of Repayment. The total loan amount is increased with the interest amount accumulated from the value date to the starting date of repayment.
- Total – without capitalised interest: the interest amount accumulated from the value date to the starting date of repayment is added to the first loan repayment.
- Partial – payment interest only: only the interest amount will be paid for the periods preceding the Starting Date of Repayment

## Disbursements

The Loan Disbursements page give the user an overview of all the capital increases and decreases occurred for the loan. The first line corresponds to the initial loan disbursement. The user can add one or more lines by specifying the Posting Date and the Amount, as long as no other disbursement or payments have been done after the Posting Date. If a decrease needs to be booked for the loan, the Amount needs to be entered with a negative sign. A fee can be added to the disbursement operation if needed.

**Figure 6 Loan Disbursement page**

## Payment Schedule

The Payment Schedule page gives the user a detailed list of past and future loan repayments. For each line the user can check the interest and capital amount, as well as the interest rate applied and other useful information. 

**The Modify function** is user for adjusting the Posting Date and the Interest for non-posted repayments. 

To cancel those changes, the functions **“Reset Line”** or **“Reset All”** can be used. 

To distinguish posted from non-posted entries, the system will show the posted entries in a red colour. 

In case where a repayment needs to be skipped, the Total Due needs to be = 0. To let the system know it needs to skip the line, the user needs to use the “Mark/Unmark as Posted” function. When the line is red (marked as posted), the user will be able to continue processing the following payments.

**Figure 7 Payment Schedule page**

## Fees

The system allows the booking of fees at any point during the life of the loan. Simply access the Fees page from the Loan Card. For each fee transaction, the system requires: the Fee Code, the Posting Date, and the Fee Amount (ICY). Previously, the user will need to set up the Fee Card for each type of fee. 

**The Fee Card requires:**

- The Fee Code
- The Fee Description
- The Commission Type which must be “Fees”
- The G/L Account specifying to which account the fee will be booked against.

## Journals & Posting procedures

### NAVCash Journal

<!--- ![Graphical user interface, application, table Description automatically generated](Aspose.Words.d55efba7-ee5d-4ac2-a23a-5f74477c2752.010.png) --->

**Figure 9 NAVCash Journal window**

The NAVCash Journal is used to generate and post loan disbursements and capital and interest repayments.

Click on the button **“Suggest Entries”** to generate posting entries. NAVCash will populate the table with the outstanding Capital and Interest payments at the desired date, for one or more loans depending on the filters. The system creates 2 distinct lines, one for the capital repayment and one for the interest repayment, as they are posted to different ledgers in the system. 

The user can delete the entries which he doesn’t want to post. However, it is important to pay attention to not delete only part of a repayment (i.e. delete the interest line and post the capital line), as the repayment will be marked by the system as fully booked. The user can look at the Document No. to know what lines are grouped together.

For loans in a foreign currency, the system will manage the difference in forex movement during the life of the loan. When the last repayment of the loan is generated and posted, the system will also post a forex realized amount. This amount is calculated based on all the historical capital repayments and adjusted as at the Posting Date of the loan closure.

Once the entries have been carefully verified, use the various available functions to:

- Preview the lines to be posted (Button: Test Report)
- Post the journal into the system (Button: Post)
- Add Dimensions to a desired journal entry (Button: Dimensions)
- Add Dimensions to several journal entries at once by selecting them (Button: DimensionsMultiple)
  
### Accrued Interest Journal

<!--- ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](Aspose.Words.d55efba7-ee5d-4ac2-a23a-5f74477c2752.011.png) --->

**Figure 10 Accrued Interest Journal window**

The Accrued Interest Journal is used to generate and post accrued interest entries for one or more loans.

Click on the button **“Suggest Entries”** to generate posting entries.

When Accrued Interest entries are posted, reversing entries are also posted at “Posting Date +1”, as the interest payment is booked at full amount and the user doesn’t have to take care of reversing manually the accrued amount.

The option “GL Integration” allows the user to choose whether he wants to post the entries to the General Ledger or not. If the entries do not need to be posted to the General Ledger Entry, the box must be unchecked; this way, the system will only post them to the sub-ledger Accrued Interest Ledger Entry.

Once the entries have been carefully verified, use the various available functions to:

- Preview the lines to be posted (Button: Test Report)
- Post the journal into the system (Button: Post)
- Add Dimensions to a desired journal entry (Button: Dimensions)
- Add Dimensions to several journal entries at once by selecting them (Button: DimensionsMultiple)
  
### NAVCash Revaluation


The Loan Revaluation Journal is used to generate and post forex revaluation entries for one or more loans.

NAVCash will use the exchange rate as at the revaluation date and adjust the Amount (LCY) accordingly.

Click on the button **“Suggest Revaluation”** to generate posting entries. When Loan Revaluation entries are posted, reversing entries are also posted at “Posting Date +1” so the user doesn’t have to take care of manually reversing the forex unrealized amount.

Once the entries have been carefully verified, use the various available functions to:

- Preview the lines to be posted (Button: Print Preview)
- Post the journal into the system (Button: Posting)
- Add Dimensions to a desired journal entry (Button: Dimensions)
- Add Dimensions to several journal entries at once by selecting them (Button: DimensionsMultiple)

### NAVCash IFRS Year End Closing

For entities complying with the IFRS regulations, Elysys Loans provides an IFRS accounting treatment. 

Within the NAVCash IFRS Year End Closing, the user can generate the needed entries to mark to market the foreign currency loans at the end of the fiscal year. NAV standard currency exchange rates are used to adjust the outstanding loan capital.

Pre-Requirement: The NAVCash Revaluation must be processed before running the IFRS Year End Closing process.

Click on the button **“Suggest Revaluation”** to generate posting entries. You will be prompted to choose from the already configured beginning periods of the fiscal years.

Once the entries have been carefully verified, use the various available functions to:

- Preview the lines to be posted (Button: Print Preview)
- Post the journal into the system (Button: Posting)
- Add Dimensions to a desired journal entry (Button: Dimensions)
- Add Dimensions to several journal entries at once by selecting them (Button: DimensionsMultiple)
 
## Functions & Navigation

<!--- ![](Aspose.Words.d55efba7-ee5d-4ac2-a23a-5f74477c2752.012.png) --->

**Figure 11 Loan Card Ribbon, Tab Functions**

### Function: Simulation

The function **Simulation** accessible from the Loan Card is very useful to print out a repayment schedule, from the Value Date up to the total repayment of the loan. 

### Function: Interest Rates

The function Interest Rates is available for Loans set up with a floating interest rate. The function opens the page Interest Rate Line List where the user can insert the new variable rate for a specific starting date.

### Function: Calendar

The function Calendar is available for Loans set up with a Market Calendar Code. The function opens the Calendar Card of the Calendar selected on the Loan Card. The user can set up non-working days, so the payments will be processed on the next working day.

### Function: Early repayment

The Early Repayment function is used when the loan must be repaid in full at an earlier date than the Maturity Date. 

The Date of Early Repayment must be:

- Greater from all lines in Disbursement Line table;
- If you have a payment schedule posted, then:
  - (Date of Early Repayment > Date of the last payment schedule posted)
- And if you haven’t a payment schedule posted: 
  - (Date of Early Repayment < Date of the first payment schedule not posted)

Along the Date of Closure, the interest amount is automatically calculated. The user can modify the interest amount to be posted if needed. Once the function has been run, the payment schedule will be updated accordingly, and the loan can be posted normally.

### Function: Renew with or without Capitalisation of Interest

The Renew Function is only available for "Interest Only Repayment" Type of Loans and Counterparty Type = "Bank".

The “Renew” function is used when a new loan is created based on an existing loan. Using this function, the user will be able to track which loan has been renewed with which other one. Additionally, it helps “cloning” an existing loan, only by changing the value and maturity dates (maturity date of the old loan becomes the value date of the new loan). 

For the renewal “with capitalisation of interest”, the amount of the newly created loan will comprise the subscribed amount of the old loan, plus the interest for the last repayment period.

For the renewal “without capitalisation of interest”, the same loan amount as on the first loan will be filled in on the new loan card created by the system.

**Figure 13 Loan Renewal without capitalisation of interest pop-up window**

### Function: Capitalise Interests

The Capitalise Interest Function is only available for "Interest Only Repayment" Type of Loans and Counterparty Type = "Bank".

With this function, the interest payments can be skipped for the current period. However, you still owe the money and you'll have to pay eventually. The interest charges are added to the loan balance, so you owe more and more as you capitalize. Capitalization is the process of adding interest charges to the existing loan balance. 

As your loan balance increases, so do future interest charges. Capitalization is confusing because you don't receive additional funds. However, you enjoy the use of that money, keeping it in your pocket instead of making a payment. Your lender acts as if you borrowed those interest payments - and you pay additional interest on those interest charges.

### Function: Change Payment Amount

The Change Payment Amount function is only available for "Fixed Capital and Interest Repayment" Type of Loans.

This function gives the possibility to change the total repayment amount of the loan (capital + interest). By default, Elysys Loans calculates the optimal repayment amount such as it is fully repaid by the maturity date entered by the user. Note that when this function is used, the maturity date of the loan will be updated based on the new repayment amount (i.e. if new amount < old amount, the new maturity date will be greater than the old maturity date).

### Function: Change Maturity Date

The Change Maturity Date Function is only available for "Interest Only Repayment” Type of Loans. This function allows the user to adjust the Maturity Date at an earlier or future date. The Payment Schedule of the Loan will change accordingly.

### Function: Cancel Loan

The Cancel Loan function can be used to “close” a loan in Elysys Loans without having to delete the card, for audit purposes for example. If a loan remains “open”, every time the user will generate the accounting entries, the capital and interest payments for that loan will appear. This function prevents this to happen. 

### Function: Pay Ad Hoc interest

The Pay Ad Hoc function is only available for “Interest Only Repayment” Type of Loans. This functions allow the user to post any amount of the interest due to be repaid before the date as in the payment schedule. Once the user will post the entire amount or jus ta portion of the interest due, the payment schedule will automatically update the remaining amount of interest du to pe paid.
