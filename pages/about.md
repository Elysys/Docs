# About

Elysys Docs is the library of technical documentation for our end users who work with Elysys products.

The content on Elysys Docs is organised into groups based on product or technology and steps of working with it: evaluating, getting started, planning, deploying, managing, and troubleshooting and the navigation panel and product/service pages show material breakdowns according to this principle. 

Each article is represented as a Markdown file in the GitHub repository.

This documentation portal is provided with information as it is. If you find something not right please do let us know.
