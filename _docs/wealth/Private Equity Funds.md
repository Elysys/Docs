## Investment Type

Now, we need to define all Investment types that will be used throughout
the investment module with their accounting rules. Investment types need
to be defined according to how investments need to be grouped and
accounted together, it is the equivalent of the product posting group of
Business Central. Investment types are required for every Investment
product ranging from Equities to Options and Forex products plus Private
Equity.

-   *Code:* Specifies the code to identify the Investment Type.

-   *Name:* Specifies the name for the Investment type.

-   *Asset Class:* Specifies the asset class relating to the investment

    managed / handled by Elysys Wealth as each asset class uses its own
    logic.

## Private Equity Posting Group

Once all investment types are created, the accounting rules must be
specified using Investment posting group.

![/assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds/Picture7.png](../../assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds/Picture7.png)

Accounting rules allows Elysys Wealth to know which account to use in
the process of creating all accounting entries when booking investment
trades. The Investment posting group page is one of the setup page used
by the module along with the coupons posting group, the forex posting
group, the options posting group, the dividends posting groups and so
on.

For each of the Investment type belonging to those assets class a
nominal account is required for the following account:

## **Private Equity Funds - Automatically Adjusting the Market Value**

The **Auto-Adjust PE Market Value** functionality allows users to automatically update the market price of the private equity funds at the same time when posting transactions.

### **Summary**
-	When processing a **capital call** or **distribution** âž” the market value increases at the date of the transaction by the amount added in the contract,
-	When processing a **capital return** âž” the market value decreases at the date of the transaction by the amount added in the contract,
-	When processing a reallocation âž” the market value is updated accordingly,
-	When processing an **impairment** âž” the market value increases at the date of the transaction by the amount added in the contract.
-	When a **PnL** transaction or a **commitment** is recorded âž” the market value doesn't change.

| Process a **capital call** | ![/assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image009.png](../../assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image009.png)|
| User is prompted with the following message | ![/assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image011.png](../../assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image011.png) |
| By choosing **Yes**, the valuation will be incremented | ![/assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image013.png](../../assets/img/PrivateEquityFunds-AutomaticallyAdjustingtheMarketValue/image013.png) |
