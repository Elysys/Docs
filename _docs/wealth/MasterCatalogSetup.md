3.  Close the page once finished.

### **Add the company in the Master Catalog**

1.  Access the Master *Company Setup* to check which is the master
    company. You do that by searching for *Master Catalog Setup* while
    logged into any company.

    ![](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image009.jpg)

2.  Next you switch to the *Master company* (from Settings \--\ My
    Settings)

    ![](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image010.jpg)

3.  Select the *Master company* and validate (OK)

    ![](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image011.jpg)

4.  Add the company in the list using the *New* function ![Table
    Description automatically
    generated](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image012.jpg)

5.  Select the tables you want to synchronise with the master.

    a. If **at least one company has already been setup**, select the new record created in the previous step, then use the Copy Tables function to duplicate the synchronised tables setup from an existing company. ![](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image016.png) All tables & table exceptions will be copied across to the new company.
    
    b.  b.	If itâ€™s the **first company to be set up** as part of the synchronisation process, navigate to the Table List. ![](../../assets/img/MasterCatalogSetup/image017.png) All tables requiring synchronisation with the Master Company will need to be listed in this page. For each table, field exceptions (fields values which should not synch for a specific table) can be set up as well.
    We recommend take advise from an Elysys consultant to proceed to the first company setup.


6.  Then you select the line with the new company, navigate to *Function
    \--\ Release.*

7. The process is finished and the new company is being synchronized. An error message shall pop up when trying to add records from the synchronized companies for the synchronized tables. New data should be entered from the Master Company only.
